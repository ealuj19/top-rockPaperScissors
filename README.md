# top-rockPaperScissors

This project will allow the user to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors
with the computer. In it's initial form, the game will be played 
completely from the console, thus having no HTML or CSS elements added 
to the page. This project will be made almost entirely with Javascript, 
and will test my planning and problem solving abilities through my first 
project using Javascript.
